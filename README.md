# Plant Classification Using Leaf Images

This repository contains a computer vision model that classifies plants using the images of its leaves. This project uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the images.

- It uses 2 pairs of `Conv2D-MaxPool2D` layers.
- It takes input of 128x128 images.
- It can differentiate between **13** different plants of fruits and vegetables.
- Due to data augmentation, it can easily handle distorted, blurry images.
